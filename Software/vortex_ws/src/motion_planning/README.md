# motion planning package

## description

this package represents four modules (localization,global planner, local planner and motion control )

Localization       : determine AUV's place in the 3d space around it and also determines the location of the obstacles and objects surrounding it.

The Global Planner : give the AUV the ability to plan the correct and feasible path through the starting point to its goal.

The Local Planner  :generate a set of control commands that‏ moves the AUV on the path generated by the Global Planner but with taking the dynamics into consideration while also trying to avoid obstacles.

motion control :translate the set of control commands from the Local Planner into actions for the thrusters‏
