# motion planning package

## description

this package represents four modules (localization,global planner, local planner and motion control )

* Localization       : determine AUV's place in the 3D space around it and also determines the location of the obstacles and objects surrounding it.

* The Global Planner : give the AUV the ability to plan the correct and feasible path through the starting point to its goal.

* The Local Planner  :generate a set of control commands that‏ moves the AUV on the path generated by the Global Planner but with taking the dynamics into consideration while also trying to avoid obstacles.

* motion control :translate the set of control commands from the Local Planner into actions for the thrusters‏

## Installation
### Installation from Packages

Open a terminal, clone the repository

        cd ~/ros2_ws/ #use your current ros2 workspace folder
	git clone https://github.com/VorteX-co/VAUV.git
    

### Building from Source

#### Dependencies

- [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/) (middleware for robotics),
-  colcon	
	
        sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

#### Building

To build from source, clone the latest version from this repository into your  workspace and compile the package using

         cd ~/ros2_ws/VAUV/Software/vortex_ws/src/mission_planning/src/
	 source /opt/ros/eloquent/setup.bash
	 colcon build --symlink-install



## Usage
 First go to project location and source it

	cd ~/ros2_ws/VAUV/Software/vortex_ws/src/mission_planning/src/
	source install/setup.bash

   * Then we can start node by node with

	ros2 run motion_planning class_name

   * or launch file with

	ros2 launch motion_planning launch_file_name.launch.
